Search Algorithms

The Assignemt has been written in C++. The Graph used has 10 vertices and 20 edges and can be seen in the file "Graph.JPG".I have defined the graph in 
terms of an adjacency list, which is also drawn out in "Graph.JPG".The attached project is a DEV-C++ 5.11 IDE project.


Depth First Search

To implement DFS, i have used a recusive function call, along with an boolean array to keep track of visited nodes.It has been illustrated in 
"Graph-DFS.png"

Breadth First Search 

To implement BFS, i have used a queue to implement this, along with an boolean array to keep track of visited nodes.It has been illustrated in
